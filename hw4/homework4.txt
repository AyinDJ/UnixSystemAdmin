Given a computer with an IP address of 10.3.12.2, provide the following information:
- What class of network is it on?
	Class A because the first octect with a value of 10 lies within the Class A range 1 - 126.

- What would you expect the netmask to be, in both CIDR and base 10 formats?
	Base 10: 255.0.0.0
	CIDR: /8

- If you were told that in fact it had a netmask of /24, and it was using the default gateway IP address for that network, provide:
	The gateway IP address: (10.3.12.2 & 255.255.255.0) + 1
							=> (10.3.12.0) + 1
							=> 10.3.12.1
	The broadcast address: 10.3.12.2 | 0.0.0.255
							=> 00001010 00000011 00001100 11111111
							=> 10.3.12.255
